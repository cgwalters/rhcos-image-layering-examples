# Replace the kernel

In this example, we override the kernel package with one from
CentOS 8 Stream.  This is just used as a stand-in for any
generic use case for overriding the kernel:

 - Applying a hotfix kernel supplied by Red Hat
 - Reverting to a another previously shipped kernel in
   the case of regression until a fix is shipped
 - Verifying whether the the CentOS Stream kernel fixes
   a regression
